## Global signal bus.
## Game-wide events go here. Local communication should use plain signals.
## Connect with: EventBus.signal_name.connect(_on_signal_name)

# ─── Field / Encounter ────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Player collided with an enemy on the field. Triggers a battle_window spawn.
signal enemy_encountered(enemy: Node)

## Player stepped onto the town field tile. Main handles the scene transition.
signal town_entered(tile: Node)

## A field event tile (campfire etc.) was triggered by walking into it.
## Main listens, pauses the field, and instantiates the matching event
## window with the right dialogue + recruit data.
signal event_tile_triggered(tile: Node)

## The town scene was just dismissed. Field listens to consume the current
## town tile and schedule the next one elsewhere on the map.
signal town_closed()

## Fires every time the rolling difficulty tier crosses another threshold.
## Tier 1 = ~30s elapsed, tier 2 = ~60s, etc. HUD listens for a toast.
